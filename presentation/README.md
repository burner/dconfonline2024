Title: Simple @safe D 

Kind: talk

Duration: 45 min

Target audience: beginner

Abstract: Make @safe D completely memory safe by removing things instead of
adding things.

Extended Description: dip1000 adds quite a bit syntax to the language and
makes D look a lot less beautiful IMO. Instead of trying to add things to the
language why not take a look at things that need to be removed to achieve the
same level of memory safety.
This talk shows how to remove three things from the language to make it
memory safe, and live with resulting consequences.

Brief Speaker Bio: Robert Schadek received a doctorate degree in computer

‘Analysis and Development of Quorum Protocols for Real-World Network
Topologies’ and focused on quorum systems in combination with graphs. Since
2018, he has been happily using D in his day job working for Symmetry
Investments.
